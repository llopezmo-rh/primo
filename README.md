# What does "primos" do?

It is a simple prime-number prospector for GNU/Linux. It looks for prime numbers in an infinite loop starting from the number passed as an argument. For example:
```
$ primos 55555
55555 is divisible by 5
55557 is divisible by 3
55559 is divisible by 7
55561 is divisible by 11
55563 is divisible by 3
55565 is divisible by 5
55567 is divisible by 181
55569 is divisible by 3
55571 is divisible by 61
55573 is divisible by 7
55575 is divisible by 3
55577 is divisible by 149
55579 IS PRIME
55581 is divisible by 3
55583 is divisible by 11
55585 is divisible by 5
55587 is divisible by 3
55589 IS PRIME
55591 is divisible by 23
55593 is divisible by 3
[...]
```

There is no size limit. Starting number can have as many ciphers as wanted. Only hardware and time are the limit.

# Compilation

## Requirement
[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/) required. It is installed by default on many GNU/Linux distributions.

## How to compile
```
$ gcc primos.c -o primos -lgmp
```


# Execution
```
$ primos -h
Usage: <executable_file> [-b] [-h] [-n <opt_n_output>] [-p] <starting_value>


Argument (mandatory):
<starting_value>: first number to calculate whether it is a prime or not.

Options:
-b: Stop execution when a prime number is found.
-h: show this help text.
-n <opt_n_output>: limit amount of numbers to calculate. With -p only prime numbers will be count.
-p: show only prime numbers.
```
